# Plant-disease-detection

## 📄 Abstract
This data contains images of diseased plant leaves acquired from a specific village in India. 
We will make use of Deep Learning to detect the type of disease a particular leaf or plant has acquired.

## 🎯 Objective 
We will be deploying the model on an app so that the user can make use of the camera on their cell phone's to capture the image of the plant leaf which in turn will be processed on our trained model to detect the type of disease in that particular plant's leaves.
